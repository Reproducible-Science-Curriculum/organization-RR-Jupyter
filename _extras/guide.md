## Overview

There are just two sections of this lesson. 

1. Activity 
2. Lesson

## Activity

One of the main functions of this activity is to provide an icebreaker for the group.  Allow them to laugh at the demo files, identify with bad habits, and share strategies on how their organize their projects.  

### Take Aways

- Every person organizes their files differently 
- Everyone has organization strategies that cause problems for themselves
- Everyone has creative ways to solve these problems 

## Slide Show

Make sure you regenerate (and commit) the HTML version of the slides if you modify the source Juputer Notebook. See the top-level `README`.

### To run slideshow locally

You can also serve the slides locally from your (the instructor's) computer. In a shell terminal run the following:

~~~
$ jupyter nbconvert --to slides 02_slideshow_organization.ipynb --post serve
~~~
{: .source}

You must be in the directory that contains slideshows (`slides/`).
