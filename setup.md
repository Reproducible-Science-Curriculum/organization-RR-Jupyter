In this lesson, we will discuss how to organize your projects and data for reproducibility.

For this lesson, you will need

1. To create and navigate directories (Explorer, Finder, or command line)
2. A text editor, such as [Notepad++](http://notepad-plus-plus.org/) or [BBEdit/TextWrangler](http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/download.html), or [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com).
3. The data file: [gapminderDataFiveYear_superDirty data.xlsx]({{ page.root }}/data/gapminderDataFiveYear_superDirty.xlsx) (also in tab-delimited text [.txt]({{ page.root }}/data/gapminderDataFiveYear_superDirty.txt))

We will not be using the Jupyter Notebook in this lesson, but you should be able to navigate to to directories we create from Jupyter.
