This lesson shows how to organize data in projects by adopting naming conventions, directory structures, and metadata standards in ways that encourage reproducibility.

We'll be exploring a data set, identifying the pitfalls of dealing with real-world data, and providing a framework for the rest of the workshop.

> ## Prerequisites
>
> - Navigate directory structures and copy files
> - Use a plain-text editor to write text files, optionally with Markdown
> - Open CSV and tab-delimited data files in a spreadsheet
