## The value of record keeping
Most data needs to be cleaned, re-organized, or otherwise prepared for subsequent data analysis. In order to do this reproducibly and effectively. When beginning a new project or analyzing new data, always remember to:

1. Organize files so that they make intuitive sense and follow the narrative of the data analysis.
2. Populate folders with metadata that describes the folder contents, where those contents came from, and gives context for the analyses that you're about to perform.
3. Always make copies of data for modification, and never over-write the raw data.
4. Keep a clear record of every modification that has been made. Ideally, this is in the form of a script that can automatically generate cleaned data from the raw data.
5. If manual cleaning is necessary, create a README file that details every single change that has been made, such that a newcomer could re-create these changes.
