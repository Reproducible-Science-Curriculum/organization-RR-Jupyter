## Lesson

See Slides.

## Key Points

- Organize files so that they make intuitive sense and follow the narrative of the data analysis.
- Populate folders with README files that describe the project and gives context for the analyses.
- Raw data remains raw and should never be modified
- Keep a clear record of every modification that has been made. Ideally, this is in the form of a script that can automatically generate cleaned data from the raw data.
