## Why READMEs
Every project should describe to users what the purpose of the project is. This is commonly done in a README file. As the starting point for a project the README file is formatted as plain text (or [markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)) to make it easily readable. A README file should include the following information:

- The project name
- The date the README was created
- Contact information for the person(s) who maintains the project
- Three or four sentences about the goal of the project
- If the project uses data from an external source, where the data is from
